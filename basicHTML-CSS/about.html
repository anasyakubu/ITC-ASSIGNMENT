        Bayero University has evolved from a small college running Advanced
        Level training programmes to one of the respected Nigerian Universities,
        recognized beyond the shores of the country. The seed of Bayero
        University Kano was the Ahmadu Bello College set up in 1960, located
        within the School for Arabic Studies (SAS), in the old city of Kano.
        With the establishment of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, in 1962, it
        was renamed Abdullahi Bayero College. In 1964 it moved to a temporary
        site at the old Kano Airport Hotel, admitting its first set of ten
        undergraduate students for a B.A. degree programme of Ahmadu Bello
        University.
